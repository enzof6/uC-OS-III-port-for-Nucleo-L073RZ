USAGE INSTRUCTIONS

TrueSTUDIO
- Import the workspace in TrueSTUDIO and make sure the "Copy projects into workspace" Options box is UNCHECKED.
- Press 'CTRL + B' to build the project and create a Debug session by selecting the Blinky workspace and pressing F11.
- Once the debug session has started, press F8 to run/resume the example.
- The project creates a task which blinks an LED every 1 second.
- Now modify the call to OSTimeDlyHMSM() in StartupTask() to increase or decrease the frequency at which the LED blinks.
- Build and run again to see the change.
