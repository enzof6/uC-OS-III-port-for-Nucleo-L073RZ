# uC-OS-III-port-for-Nucleo-L073RZ



1. Download project and unzip.
2. After unzipping copy and paste the "Micrium_STM32L073RZ_Nucleo_Blinky" folder to the root of the c:\ drive.
3. Navigate to "Micrium_STM32L073RZ_Nucleo_Blinky/STM32L073RZ_Nucleo/ST/STM32L073RZ_Nucleo/Blinky/OS3/TrueSTUDIO/" and you will see a folder and two files. Edit the names of all three so they include a dot at the start of all three. (i.e. ".settings",".cproject",".project") This is so as i was unable to commit the files and folder with . perfixes to github. 
4. Open project in Atollic TrueStudio and enjoy.
